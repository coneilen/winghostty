# Windows Tests

Manual and interactive harnesses for Windows-specific functionality.

Each interactive Win11 harness uses its own repo-local sandbox under
`.sandbox\win11\<worktree-id>\<sandbox-name>`, so `-ResetState` resets
only that harness's logs/temp state instead of tearing down sibling
validators.

## interactive-win11-validate.ps1

Composite Win11 validator. It runs launch-helper checks and startup smoke,
then runs the command-finish and progress validators in parallel against
separate sandbox roots.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-validate.ps1 -ResetState
```

From the repository root, pass `-Rebuild` to force one upfront
`.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd zig build -Demit-exe=true` before the suite starts.
The suite also does that upfront build automatically
when tracked inputs are newer than `zig-out\bin\winghostty.exe`, so child
harnesses reuse one fresh binary instead of rebuilding in parallel.

## interactive-win11-smoke.ps1

Interactive Win11 startup smoke validation. It launches `winghostty`
inside the repo-local Win11 sandbox and waits for shell startup to be
observed in stderr.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-smoke.ps1 -ResetState -TimeoutSeconds 10
```

## interactive-win11-command-finish.ps1

Interactive Win11 validation for command-finished notifications. It launches
`winghostty` inside the repo-local Win11 sandbox, emits raw OSC `133;C`,
OSC `9;4`, and OSC `133;D;17`, and then validates that the
command-finished path fired.

- If Windows toast delivery is enabled for the current user, the script
  asserts the command-finished path completed without a WinRT toast
  failure.
- If Windows toast delivery is disabled for the current user or app, the
  script asserts the runtime logs the explicit
  `error.NotifierDisabled; falling back to banner` path instead of
  silently dropping the notification.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-command-finish.ps1 -ResetState -TimeoutSeconds 12
```

The harness rebuilds automatically when `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon`, or
files under `src\` are newer than `zig-out\bin\winghostty.exe`. Pass
`-Rebuild` to force a full rebuild anyway.

## vt-probe-win32-conformance.ps1

Win32 VT protocol conformance metadata validation. It runs `+vt-probe` and
asserts that each capability reports a separate Win32-runtime
classification:

- `validated` means an interactive Win32 harness exercises the behavior.
- `parser-only` means shared parser/core support exists, but no Win32 GUI
  behavior is validated.
- `pending` means the Win32 behavior exists or is expected, but the practical
  harness is still missing.

Run the fast metadata check with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\vt-probe-win32-conformance.ps1 -ResetState -TimeoutSeconds 10
```

Pass `-Runtime` to also run the heavier Win32 evidence harnesses currently
referenced by `+vt-probe`: command finish / notification, taskbar progress,
and synchronized-output repaint performance.

## interactive-win11-progress.ps1

Interactive Win11 validation for native progress state changes. It
launches `winghostty` inside the repo-local Win11 sandbox, emits raw
OSC `9;4` state transitions for `set`, `pause`, `error`,
`indeterminate`, and `remove`, captures the `winghostty` window via
screenshots for each state, and fails if:

- the runtime logs `taskbar progress init failed`,
  `taskbar progress sync failed`, or a crash
- the runtime never logs one of the expected taskbar progress sync
  states (`set`, `pause`, `error`, `indeterminate`, `remove`)

The script reports whether captured `set`/`remove` and `pause`/`error`
window images differ, and does the same for bottom-of-screen strips.
These image comparisons are diagnostic only: hosted desktop environments
do not always expose the rendered shell surface or Explorer taskbar to
screen capture, and bottom-strip captures can include unrelated desktop
content.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-progress.ps1 -ResetState -TimeoutSeconds 20
```

## interactive-win11-shaders.ps1

Interactive Win11 validation for custom post-processing shaders. It builds
with `-Dcustom-shaders=true`, loads a deterministic solid-magenta ShaderToy
fixture, captures the terminal surface child window, and fails unless the
dominant sampled surface color is magenta.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-shaders.ps1 -Rebuild -ResetState
```

## interactive-win11-resize.ps1

Interactive Win11 validation for resize repaint coverage. It launches
`winghostty` with a light terminal background, synthesizes a live resize
growth, exits the resize loop, captures the settled enlarged window, and fails
if the newly exposed right or bottom content bands are mostly near-black or
unpainted neutral gray.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-resize.ps1 -ResetState -TimeoutSeconds 15
```

## interactive-win11-ime-candidate.ps1

Interactive Win11 validation for IME candidate anchoring. It launches
`winghostty`, scripts the terminal cursor to a non-origin row/column,
sends a synthetic mouse move near the surface origin to poison the old
mouse-derived path, triggers `WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION` on the surface
HWND, and reads the env-gated runtime trace for the composition/candidate
forms computed inside `positionImeWindow()`.

The harness verifies that the traced candidate form uses `CFS_EXCLUDE`,
shares the composition point, exposes a caret-height exclusion rect, and
lands near the scripted caret instead of the poisoned mouse coordinate. It
does not assert that Windows created an IME context or that a real IME
language pack renders a visible candidate popup; that remains
manual/IME-environment coverage.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-ime-candidate.ps1 -ResetState -TimeoutSeconds 18
```

## interactive-win11-undo.ps1

Interactive Win11 validation for the shipped undo/redo action set. It launches
`winghostty`, exercises split creation, tab close/restore, and empty-host
survival after last-tab close, then verifies the visible tab/surface counts
after each replay step. Last-tab headless undo/redo remains covered by focused
Zig tests plus manual validation; this harness does not claim foreground
keyboard coverage.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-undo.ps1 -ResetState -TimeoutSeconds 35
```

## interactive-win11-palette-theme.ps1

Validates Universal Palette theme preview, Escape rollback, Enter commit and
config persistence, plus suppression of theme preview while Windows High
Contrast is active. High Contrast mutation is opt-in with
`-ExerciseHighContrast`; the harness serializes that phase and restores the
original system setting in `finally`.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-palette-theme.ps1 -ResetState
```

## interactive-win11-session-restore.ps1

Validates a three-tab session save/restart restore with the second tab selected,
then injects corrupt state and requires a fresh one-tab launch plus a uniquely
named quarantine artifact.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\interactive-win11-session-restore.ps1 -ResetState
```

## ..\..\scripts\interactive-win11.ps1

Generic repo-local Win11 launcher for ad hoc debugging. It uses the
same sandbox/bootstrap logic as the focused harnesses and can either
launch `winghostty` directly or open a shell with the sandbox
environment applied.

Run with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\..\scripts\interactive-win11.ps1 -ResetState
```

## test_dll_init.c

Regression test for the DLL CRT initialization fix. Loads ghostty.dll
at runtime and calls ghostty_info + ghostty_init to verify the MSVC C
runtime is properly initialized.

### Build

From the repository root, first build ghostty.dll, then compile the test:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd zig build -Dapp-runtime=none -Demit-exe=false
Push-Location .\test\windows
..\..\scripts\dev-windows.cmd zig cc test_dll_init.c -o test_dll_init.exe -target native-native-msvc
Pop-Location
```

### Run

From this directory:

```powershell
copy ..\..\zig-out\lib\ghostty.dll . && test_dll_init.exe
```

Expected output (after the CRT fix):

```text
ghostty_info: <version string>
```

The ghostty_info call verifies the DLL loads and the CRT is initialized.
Before the fix, loading the DLL would crash with "access violation writing
0x0000000000000024".

## run-win32-host-renderer.ps1

External host contract for the embeddable renderer. It validates caller-owned
parenting, child HWND/HDC/HGLRC ownership, UI/render thread affinity,
visibility/bounds/theme/font-scale updates, synchronous WGL presentation and
teardown, renderer-entry races against surface/host destruction, and 100
create/destroy cycles with USER/GDI handle counts. The teardown stress also
enters the public host, mutation, notification, renderer, and getter APIs
while destruction is in progress, and verifies stale handles cannot affect
replacement objects after allocator address reuse. It also has a parent
`WM_PARENTNOTIFY` handler that calls host deinitialization during child
destruction and verifies deferred teardown completes without a deadlock. A
1024-cycle parent-reentrant teardown run measures process-heap busy
blocks/bytes to catch retained `SurfaceState` and copied options beyond
USER/GDI accounting. A 1024-cycle numeric-handle run measures process-heap
busy blocks/bytes to catch registry and retired-token growth beyond USER/GDI
accounting. Persistent
context coverage switches render-thread ownership from surface A to B, clears
B, destroys A on the UI thread, and switches B again.

```powershell
.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\test\windows\run-win32-host-renderer.ps1
```
