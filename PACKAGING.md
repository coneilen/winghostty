# Packaging winghostty for Distribution

This repository publishes Windows user artifacts directly from GitHub
Releases. The public packaging targets are:

- `winghostty-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe`
- `winghostty-<version>-windows-x64-portable.zip`
- `winghostty-<version>-windows-arm64-setup.exe`
- `winghostty-<version>-windows-arm64-portable.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS-windows-x64.txt`
- `SHA256SUMS-windows-arm64.txt`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` legacy alias for existing x64 auto-update clients

Primary distribution URL:

```text
https://github.com/amanthanvi/winghostty/releases
```

## Release Inputs

winghostty releases use plain semver tags such as `v1.3.100`:

- `major.minor` track the Ghostty upstream compatibility line
- `patch` is the winghostty release number on that line
- fork releases start at patch `100` for a new upstream line

The exact upstream base release is stored in
`dist/windows/release-metadata.json`. For example, a release tagged
`v1.3.105` can still declare `upstreamBaseVersion = 1.3.2`.

The release workflow builds the Windows executable, stages runtime files,
then produces:

1. An Inno Setup installer
2. A portable ZIP
3. SHA256 checksums for published assets
4. A release icon asset
5. Generated package-manager metadata

Local unsigned packaging is allowed for smoke validation, but the GitHub
Release workflow requires signing and fails closed when signing is absent.
The release installer and Windows PE files inside the portable ZIP are
Authenticode-signed; the ZIP container itself is checksummed, not
Authenticode-signed.

Before publication, the Release workflow updates Microsoft Defender
signatures and scans both setup artifacts plus the six PE files extracted from
the portable ZIPs, with remediation disabled. A missing or inactive scanner,
update or scan error, or detection fails the release. This is a current-engine
regression gate for the published Windows executable bytes; it does not replace
a publicly trusted signing identity or reproduce every enterprise security
policy.

## Local Packaging

Build the app first:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd zig build -Demit-exe=true
```

x64 packaging also requires LLVM's `llvm-objdump` on `PATH` or in the
standard LLVM installation directory. The packaging gate disassembles every
runtime PE and rejects AMD-only SSE4a instructions so published x64 builds
retain the documented baseline CPU compatibility. Executable PE sections are
treated as code; intentional constants must remain in non-executable sections.

If Zig cannot hydrate its dependency cache automatically in your
environment, seed the Windows build dependency cache first:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\fetch-zig-deps.ps1
.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd zig build -Demit-exe=true
```

Then stage release assets:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\package-windows.ps1 -Version 1.3.100
```

In a native Windows ARM64 PowerShell process, the packaging script defaults
to ARM64. An x64/emulated shell defaults to x64, even on ARM64 hardware.
Pass `-Architecture x64` or `-Architecture arm64` explicitly when you need a
specific target.

If Inno Setup is available on the machine, the packaging script can also
build the installer. If it is not installed, the portable artifact and
checksums are still produced so packaging can be validated locally.

To exercise the local signing path, export these environment variables
first:

```powershell
$env:WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PFX_PATH = "C:\secure\winghostty-signing.pfx"
$env:WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PFX_PASSWORD = "<pfx-password>"
$env:WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TRUST_SELF_SIGNED = "true" # only for internal/self-signed PFXs
.\scripts\dev-windows.cmd powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\package-windows.ps1 `
  -Version 1.3.100 `
  -RequireInstaller `
  -RequireSigning
```

To generate the package-manager metadata from staged release assets:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/package-package-managers.ps1 `
  -Version 1.3.100 `
  -Architectures @("x64", "arm64") `
  -UpstreamBaseVersion 1.3.2 `
  -FirstForkPatch 100
```

This emits:

- `dist/artifacts/winghostty-<version>-windows-x64/package-managers/scoop/`
- `dist/artifacts/winghostty-<version>-windows-x64/package-managers/metadata.json`

## Release Automation

The release workflow publishes to the official Windows package-manager
tracks after the GitHub Release is live. The preflight fails closed unless
signing is configured and both remote package-manager manifests already
exist. Release metadata comes from the committed
`dist/windows/release-metadata.json` file, so the release tag, generated
package-manager metadata, and GitHub release notes all agree on the current
upstream base.

Automated releases should use a dedicated GitHub Actions environment named
`release`. The workflow resolves signing secrets from that environment or
the repo default secret scope and runs `scripts/release-preflight.ps1`
before build/test/package work starts.

### Authenticode Signing

Required for the GitHub `Release` workflow:

- Secret: `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PFX_BASE64`
- Secret: `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PFX_PASSWORD`

Optional:

- Environment or repo variable: `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TIMESTAMP_URL`
  Default: `http://timestamp.digicert.com`
- Environment or repo variable: `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TRUST_SELF_SIGNED`
  Default: unset / false

Recommended setup:

1. Export a password-protected `.pfx` that contains the private key and full
   certificate chain for the Windows code-signing identity.
2. Base64-encode that file locally.
3. Store the base64 and password in the `release` environment, not plain
   repo scope, so release signing stays isolated from unrelated workflows.

Example `gh` commands:

```powershell
$repo = "amanthanvi/winghostty"
$pfxPath = "C:\secure\winghostty-signing.pfx"
$pfxBase64 = [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($pfxPath))

$pfxBase64 | gh secret set WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PFX_BASE64 --repo $repo --env release
gh secret set WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PFX_PASSWORD --repo $repo --env release --body "<pfx-password>"
gh variable set WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TIMESTAMP_URL --repo $repo --env release --body "http://timestamp.digicert.com"
gh variable set WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TRUST_SELF_SIGNED --repo $repo --env release --body "true"
```

If you prefer a different RFC 3161/Authenticode timestamp service, set
`WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TIMESTAMP_URL` explicitly. The packaging script defaults
to DigiCert when the variable is absent.

> **Security note:** set `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TRUST_SELF_SIGNED` in the
> `release` environment only while the release identity is intentionally
> self-signed, and remove it as soon as a publicly trusted certificate is in
> use — with the variable unset, signature validation fails closed on
> untrusted roots instead of accepting them.

When `WINDOWS_CODESIGN_TRUST_SELF_SIGNED=true`, signature validation accepts
the expected self-signed signer thumbprint plus the narrow untrusted-root
statuses reported by `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`. This keeps
internal/self-signed release probes green on the current runner — but it
does not create public publisher trust on other machines. Until winghostty
moves from internal/self-signed signing to a publicly trusted certificate,
treat SmartScreen and publisher trust as incomplete.

### Release Runbook

Recommended order:

1. Update `dist/windows/release-metadata.json` if the upstream compatibility
   line or `firstForkPatch` changed.
2. Configure or rotate the `release` environment signing secrets.
3. Run the **Release Readiness** workflow with the target plain semver
   version, for example `1.3.107`.
4. After readiness passes, either:
   - push tag `v<version>`, or
   - manually dispatch the **Release** workflow with `version=<version>`.
5. Confirm the workflow published artifacts for both x64 and ARM64:
   - installer
   - portable ZIP
   - `SHA256SUMS-windows-<arch>.txt`
   - legacy x64 `SHA256SUMS.txt`
   - GitHub Release notes/assets
6. Confirm follow-on publishes:
   - Scoop manifest update
   - WinGet submission

If a tag already exists and the workflow failed before publish, configure
the missing signing secrets and then rerun the failed `Release` workflow or
manually dispatch **Release** with the same version. The workflow is
idempotent for release creation/upload because it uses `gh release create`
on first publish and `gh release upload --clobber` on reruns.

### WinGet

- Secret: `WINGETCREATE_TOKEN`
- Repo variable: `WINGET_PACKAGE_IDENTIFIER`
- Current automation path: `wingetcreate update ... --submit`

The official WinGet package is bootstrapped as `AmanThanvi.winghostty`.
Release preflight verifies that
`microsoft/winget-pkgs/manifests/a/AmanThanvi/winghostty` exists before the
release workflow can claim package-manager readiness. Keep CI on the
truthful `update` path; do not switch to `wingetcreate new` for automated
releases.

### Scoop

- Secret: `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN`
- Repo variable: `SCOOP_BUCKET_REPO`
- Optional repo variables: `SCOOP_BUCKET_BRANCH`, `SCOOP_BUCKET_MANIFEST_PATH`

The workflow updates a manifest in a configured Scoop bucket repository. It
does not attempt to auto-open PRs against `ScoopInstaller/Extras`; that path
is review-driven and should stay explicit.

The official Scoop track is the fork-owned bucket:

```powershell
scoop bucket add winghostty https://github.com/amanthanvi/scoop-winghostty
scoop install winghostty/winghostty
```

Release preflight verifies that the configured manifest exists, defaulting
to `bucket/winghostty.json` when `SCOOP_BUCKET_MANIFEST_PATH` is unset.

## Zig Version

This repo is pinned to Zig `0.15.2` in CI, and packaging should use the same
Zig version unless the repo is intentionally updated to a newer one. The
full toolchain rules live in [HACKING.md](HACKING.md#toolchain).

## Library Consumers

`libghostty-vt` remains intentionally retained and keeps its existing public
name. The app binary and Windows packaging are rebranded to `winghostty`,
but the library surface is not being renamed as part of this packaging
cleanup.
